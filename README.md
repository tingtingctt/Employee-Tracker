# Employee-Tracker

## Functionality Video


## Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. This app aims to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

The command-line application allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

The database is pre-populated with `seeds.sql` and `schema.sql` files to demonstrate the app's functionality.
